# Java-Map-Framework-Practical-Examples
Welcome to the Java Map Framework Practical Examples repository! This repository contains a set of practical examples demonstrating the usage of the Map framework in Java.

What is the Map Framework?
The Map framework in Java provides a powerful way to store and manipulate key-value pairs. It offers various implementations such as HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap, and more, each with its own characteristics and use cases.

Contents:
HashMap Examples: Explore practical scenarios showcasing the usage of HashMap, a widely-used implementation of the Map interface, known for its fast retrieval and insertion operations.

TreeMap Examples: Dive into examples illustrating TreeMap, which maintains key-value pairs in sorted order based on the natural ordering of its keys or a specified comparator.

LinkedHashMap Examples: Discover how LinkedHashMap preserves the insertion order of its elements, making it suitable for scenarios where order matters.

How to Use:
Each directory contains Java source files demonstrating specific functionalities of the Map framework. You can browse through the examples, examine the code, and run them in your Java development environment to see the Map framework in action.
